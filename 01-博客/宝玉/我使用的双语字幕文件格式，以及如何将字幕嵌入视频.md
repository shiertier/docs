## 摘要

**1) 一句话总结**
本文介绍了作者使用的 ASS 双语字幕格式及其具体的字体、排版参数，并提供了使用 ffmpeg 命令行将字幕硬编码嵌入视频的具体方法。

**2) 关键要点**
*   **字幕格式选择**：采用 ASS (Advanced SubStation Alpha) 高级字幕格式，支持丰富的样式设置、多样式并存以及图层（Layer）叠加。
*   **中文字幕样式**：使用荣耀黑体（HONOR Sans CN），字号 24（代码示例中为 20），黄色字体，2 像素黑色边框，无阴影。
*   **英文字幕样式**：使用 Helvetica 字体，字号 12，白色字体，2 像素黑色边框，无阴影。
*   **位置对齐（Alignment）**：方位值与数字小键盘位置一一对应（例如“2”代表屏幕正下方，“8”代表正上方）。
*   **时间轴与排版**：中英文字幕时间轴无需一一对应；在同一时间段、同一图层（Layer）且对齐方式相同时，字幕会自动上下排列（如英文字幕顺序在前则在下方，中文在上方）。
*   **视频嵌入工具**：直接使用 `ffmpeg` 命令行工具将 ASS 字幕文件嵌入视频。
*   **核心执行命令**：`ffmpeg -i "输入视频.mp4" -vf ass="字幕文件.ass" "输出视频.mp4"`。

经常有朋友问我字幕格式是什么？

我是用的 ASS 字幕格式，可以对字幕设置样式，并且可以支持多种样式并存。

> SSA、ASS 格式
>
>
> SSA（Sub Station Alpha）是为了解决 SRT 过于简单的字幕功能而开发的高级字幕格式，其扩展名为.SSA。采用 SSA V4 脚本语言，能实现丰富的字幕功能，除了能设定不同字幕数据的大小和位置外，更能实现动态文本和水印等复杂的功能。ASS（Advanced SubStation Alpha）为是更高级的 SSA 版本，采用 SSA V4+ 脚本语言编写。它包含了所有 SSA 的所有特性，它可以将任何简单的文本转变成为卡拉 OK 的字幕样式，数个项目旨在创建这些脚本。ASS 的特点在于它比普通的 SSA 更为规范，如 ASS 的编程风格。

![Image 2: 我的字幕参数设置](https://baoyu.io/images/translation/subtitle-and-ffmpeg/F5ueUCRWcAABx2q.jpeg)

我的字幕参数设置

中文和英文我用了两种不同的样式，中文样式中字体是倪爽老师建议的荣耀黑体，24 号字，黄色字加 2 黑色边框无阴影，英文样式的字体是 Helvetica，12 号，白色字加 2 黑色边框无阴影。

![Image 3](https://baoyu.io/images/translation/subtitle-and-ffmpeg/F5ufJwgW4AADA-k.png)

字幕样式的 alignment 表示字幕显示的方位，alignment 的值和数字小键盘的位置一一对应，2 就表示在屏幕正下方，比如 8 就是正上方。

英文和中文字幕的时间轴不是一一对应的，因为中文和英文语序不一样，一条中文字幕可能对应若干条英文字幕，所以有时候你能看到一条长的中文字幕保持不变，下面的英文字幕一直在换。

对 ass 来说不是什么问题，因为在同一时间范围可以有多条不同样式字幕，如果是在同一个 layer，那么就一上一下，如果不同 layer，还可以让字幕重叠。

![Image 4](https://baoyu.io/images/translation/subtitle-and-ffmpeg/F5uf5QWWEAAHJaI.jpeg)

比如这个字幕文件里面，中文字幕的样式和英文字幕样式都在同一个 layer，并且 alignment 都是在 2，英文字幕顺序在前面，所以英文字幕就会在下面，中文字幕在上面。

至于如何将字幕嵌入视频，我直接用的 ffmpeg 的命令行：

ffmpeg -i "Steve Jobs Content vs Process.mp4" -vf ass="Steve Jobs Content vs Process.ass" "Steve Jobs Content vs Process output.mp4"

Dialogue: 1,0:00:23.3,0:00:26.44,Secondary,,0,0,0,,And all that was needed was for the high priests and priestesses and monks

Dialogue: 1,0:02:49.10,0:02:52.43,Secondary,,0,0,0,,Maybe it could suggest to him to make more of it on a Friday afternoon.

Dialogue: 1,0:02:53.46,0:02:54.26,Secondary,,0,0,0,,Now, you might say to me,
